# Security Notice - Firebase Auth User Deletion

## Current Implementation

The current implementation stores user passwords temporarily in Firestore to enable complete user deletion from Firebase Authentication. This is done because:

1. **Firebase Admin SDK is not available** in Flutter client apps
2. **Direct user deletion** requires the user to be authenticated
3. **Re-authentication is needed** to delete a user account

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Storing passwords in Firestore is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for production use.

### Current Approach (Development/Demo):
- Passwords are stored in `authPassword` field in Firestore
- Used only for user deletion purposes
- Deleted along with user data

### Production Recommendations:

1. **Use Firebase Cloud Functions** with Firebase Admin SDK:
   ```javascript
   const admin = require('firebase-admin');
   
   exports.deleteUser = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
     // Verify admin privileges
     const uid = data.uid;
     await admin.auth().deleteUser(uid);
     return { success: true };
   });
   ```

2. **Use Firebase Admin SDK** on your backend server

3. **Implement proper authentication flow** with re-authentication

## Alternative Solutions:

1. **Disable accounts instead of deletion** - Set user as inactive
2. **Use Firebase Extensions** for user management  
3. **Implement server-side user management** with Admin SDK

## Current Status:
This implementation is suitable for:
- ✅ Development and testing
- ✅ Educational purposes
- ✅ Proof of concept applications
- ❌ Production applications with sensitive data

For production use, please implement proper server-side user management.
