## Description

The Attendance System is a mobile application developed using **Flutter** and **Firebase** that simplifies attendance management in educational institutions. Users can log in with their registered email addresses through Firebase Authentication and are redirected to specific pages based on their rolesâ€”students or teachers.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login using registered email addresses via Firebase Authentication.
- **Role-Based Access:** Students and teachers have different interfaces tailored to their needs.
- **QR Code Scanning:** Students can easily mark their attendance by scanning QR codes associated with their classes. This feature ensures a quick, secure, and efficient way to record attendance.
- **QR Code Generation:** Teachers can generate QR codes for each subject, allowing students to scan them to mark their attendance. The QR codes are tied to the subject names.(u can use a script to generate qr_images based on subject name)
- **Attendance Tracking for Teachers:** Teachers can view a comprehensive list of students who have attended their classes, making it easier to manage attendance records.

Here are some screenshots of the application showcasing its UI and key functionality:

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
- A Firebase project set up for authentication and database.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Utsav-gajera/Attendance-System
   ```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
- A Firebase project set up for authentication and database services.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:** First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Utsav-gajera/Attendance-System.git`

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Move into the project directory using the following command:  
   `cd Attendance-System`

3. **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install all necessary Flutter dependencies:  
   `flutter pub get`

4. **Set up Firebase:** You'll need to set up Firebase for authentication and database services.  
   a. **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click on **Add Project**, and follow the instructions to create a new project.  
   b. **Enable Firebase Authentication:** In your Firebase Console, navigate to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**, and enable the **Email/Password** provider.  
   c. **Set up Cloud Firestore:** In Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database**, and create a new Firestore database. Start in "Test Mode" for development, but ensure you configure security rules later for production.  
   d. **Download Firebase Configuration Files:**

   - **For Android:** Download the `google-services.json` file from Firebase Console and place it in the `android/app` directory of your Flutter project.
   - **For iOS:** Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory.

5. **Configure Firebase in Your Flutter Project:** In your `pubspec.yaml` file, ensure that the following dependencies are included:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     firebase_core: latest_version
     firebase_auth: latest_version
     cloud_firestore: latest_version
     qr_code_scanner: latest_version
   ```

Then run:
flutter pub get

6. **Run the app:** Once everything is set up, run the application on an emulator or physical device using:
   flutter run

- Ensure your Firebase project is correctly linked, and you can now start using the app!

## Usage

Students: Log in and scan the class QR code to mark attendance.
