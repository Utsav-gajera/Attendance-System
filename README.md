## Description

The Attendance System is a mobile application developed using **Flutter** and **Firebase** that simplifies attendance management in educational institutions. Users can log in with their registered email addresses through Firebase Authentication and are redirected to specific pages based on their rolesâ€”students or teachers.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login using registered email addresses via Firebase Authentication.
- **Role-Based Access:** Students and teachers have different interfaces tailored to their needs.

- **Attendance Tracking for Teachers:** Teachers can view a comprehensive list of students who have attended their classes, making it easier to manage attendance records.
